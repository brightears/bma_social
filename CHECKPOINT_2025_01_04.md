## Known Issues and Limitations

### Technical Limitations
1. **Real-time Updates**: Currently using polling instead of WebSockets
2. **File Storage**: Using local storage, S3 integration pending
3. **Background Jobs**: Basic implementation, needs Celery for robustness
4. **Search**: No full-text search implementation yet
5. **Caching**: Redis not yet implemented for performance

### Feature Limitations
1. **Channels**: Only WhatsApp is currently integrated
2. **Analytics**: Basic metrics only, no advanced reporting
3. **Automation**: No workflow automation yet
4. **Notifications**: No push notifications system
5. **Mobile**: No mobile app or responsive design for phones

### Performance Considerations
1. **Large Contact Lists**: May experience slowdown with >10,000 contacts
2. **Message History**: Long conversations need pagination optimization
3. **PDF Generation**: Can be slow for complex quotations
4. **Bulk Operations**: Limited to batches of 100 for safety

## Next Steps and Roadmap

## Important Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **FastAPI** chosen for async support and automatic API documentation
2. **React with TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
3. **PostgreSQL** for reliable relational data with JSON support
4. **JWT authentication** for stateless, scalable auth
5. **Separate webhook router** for flexibility in webhook handling

### Code Organization
- **Backend**: Clean architecture with separate layers (models, services, API)
- **Frontend**: Component-based with custom hooks for business logic
- **Shared types**: TypeScript interfaces matching backend Pydantic models
- **Error handling**: Centralized error handling in both frontend and backend

### Security Considerations
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiration and refresh mechanism
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- XSS protection in React
- CORS properly configured

### Testing Strategy
- Backend: Unit tests for services, integration tests for APIs
- Frontend: Component testing with React Testing Library
- E2E: Cypress setup ready but tests not written
- Manual testing: Comprehensive testing done for all features

### Deployment Notes
- **Zero-downtime deployments** possible with current setup
- **Database migrations** must be run manually
- **Environment variables** managed through Render dashboard
- **Logs** available through Render CLI or dashboard
- **Monitoring** basic metrics available, APM tool recommended

### Development Workflow
1. Feature branches from `main`
2. Local testing with Docker (docker-compose available)
3. PR review before merge
4. Automatic deployment on merge to main
5. Rollback capability through Git

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Tasks
- **Daily**: Monitor error logs and system health
- **Weekly**: Review analytics and performance metrics
- **Monthly**: Database optimization (VACUUM, REINDEX)
- **Quarterly**: Security audit and dependency updates

### Backup Strategy
- Database: Daily automated backups with 7-day retention
- Code: Git repository with full history
- Media files: Need S3 backup implementation
- Configuration: Document all environment variables

### Monitoring Checklist
- API response times < 200ms average
- Database CPU < 70%
- Error rate < 1%
- Webhook success rate > 99%
- User session duration > 5 minutes
